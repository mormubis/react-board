# Backlog

Last updated: 2026-04-04

## High

- [x] ~~Highlight squares persist~~ — decided to keep `highlight` generic;
      consumers manage clearing. No `lastMove` prop needed.
- [x] ~~CSS-variable-based theming~~ — removed `theme` prop and `BoardTheme`
      type. All styling via `--board-*` CSS variables with `var()` fallbacks.
- [x] ~~Coordinate labels too large~~ — font size 15% (was 25%), weight 600 via
      `--board-coordinate-weight`, two color variables done in theming.
- [x] ~~No turn restriction~~ — added `turn` prop (`'white' | 'black'`) that
      restricts drag and click-select to the matching color.

## Medium

- [ ] Storybook — replace `playground/` with Storybook 10 for interactive
      component documentation. Stories for all prop combinations, theme
      variants, controls. Reference `react-movesheet/.storybook/` setup.
- [ ] Promotion UI — when a pawn reaches the last rank, show a piece selection
      dialog instead of auto-promoting to queen.
- [ ] Move sound effects — play sounds on move, capture, check. Optional,
      disabled by default.
- [ ] Piece shadow during drag — add a subtle drop shadow to the floating ghost
      piece for better visual feedback.

## Future (v2)

- [ ] Arrow drawing (SVG overlay)
- [ ] Premove support
- [ ] Right-click annotations
- [ ] Touch gesture improvements
- [ ] Additional bundled piece sets
